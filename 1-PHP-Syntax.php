/*
Variable names in PHP are case-sensitive. 
The variables $color, $Color and $COLOR are treated as three different variables.

Keywords, function and classes names are case-insensitive. 
As a result calling the gettype() or GETTYPE() produce the same result.

<?..The PHP delimiter <?php and ?> in the following example simply tells the PHP engine to treat the enclosed code block as PHP code, 
instead of just HTML..?>
