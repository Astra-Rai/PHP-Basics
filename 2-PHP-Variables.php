In PHP, a variable does not need to be declared before adding a value to it. 
PHP automatically converts the variable to the correct data type, depending on its value.
 
Variables in PHP start $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
A variable must start with a letter or the underscore character _.
A variable name cannot start with a number.
 
 
Hello, variables, echo
